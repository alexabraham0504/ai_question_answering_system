{"question": "What is science?", "answer": "Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation and experimentation.", "context": "Science is the study of the natural world through observation and experimentation."}
{"question": "What are the main branches of science?", "answer": "Physical Science (physics, chemistry), Life Science (biology, ecology), and Earth and Space Science (geology, astronomy).", "context": "Science is divided into several main branches that focus on different aspects of the natural world."}
{"question": "What is physics?", "answer": "Physics studies matter, energy, and their interactions, including forces like gravity, electricity, and magnetism.", "context": "Physics is one of the fundamental branches of physical science."}
{"question": "What is chemistry?", "answer": "Chemistry studies matter, its composition, structure, properties, and the changes it undergoes.", "context": "Chemistry examines the composition, structure, and properties of matter."}
{"question": "What is biology?", "answer": "Biology studies living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment.", "context": "Biology is the branch of life science that focuses on living organisms."}
{"question": "What is the scientific method?", "answer": "The scientific method involves making observations, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions.", "context": "The scientific method is a systematic approach used by scientists."}
{"question": "Why is science important?", "answer": "Science helps us understand the world, solve problems, make informed decisions, and develop new technologies that improve our lives.", "context": "Science plays a crucial role in solving real-world problems."}
{"question": "What is geology?", "answer": "Geology studies Earth's structure, composition, and processes, including rocks, minerals, and natural forces like earthquakes and volcanoes.", "context": "Geology is part of Earth and Space Science."}
{"question": "What is the difference between physical and life science?", "answer": "Physical science studies non-living matter and energy (physics, chemistry), while life science studies living organisms and their processes (biology, ecology).", "context": "Physical science and life science are two main branches of science."}
{"question": "How does science help solve problems?", "answer": "Science provides systematic methods to understand issues, develop solutions, and test their effectiveness through research and experimentation.", "context": "Science provides the tools and methods needed to address challenges."}
