## 🎯 Usage

### Web Interface Features

- **🤖 Model Selection**: Choose between base model and fine-tuned model
- **📝 Question Input**: Type your questions in the main text area
- **📋 Context Input**: Provide additional context if needed
- **🎯 Sample Questions**: Use pre-generated questions from the dataset
- **⚡ Real-time Answers**: Get instant, concise responses
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices

### Sample Questions

The system is trained to answer science-related questions such as:
- "What is science?"
- "What are the main branches of science?"
- "What is physics?"
- "What is chemistry?"
- "What is the scientific method?"

## 🔧 Training Your Own Model

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

1. **Replace the PDF**: Put your content in `Science_Content_Sample.pdf`
2. **Or use custom dataset**: Create a JSONL file with your Q&A pairs

### Step 2: Run Training

```bash
python final_correct_training.py
```

This script will:
- ✅ Load the base flan-t5-small model
- ✅ Process your dataset
- ✅ Fine-tune the model for 50 epochs
- ✅ Save the optimized model
- ✅ Test the results

### Step 3: Test Results

The training script includes comprehensive testing that shows:
- Expected vs generated answers
- Answer length comparison
- Model performance metrics

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Training Parameters

In `final_correct_training.py`, you can adjust:

```python
# Training settings
learning_rate = 3e-5
num_train_epochs = 50
per_device_train_batch_size = 1
max_length = 128  # For short answers
```

### Model Settings

In `app.py`, you can modify:

```python
# Generation parameters
max_length = 128
num_beams = 3
temperature = 0.8
```
